// When a pipeline script is launched, Nextflow looks for this nextflow.config file.
// This file defines settings and properties and can be organized into different scopes.

// The manifest scope lets you define some metadata.
// The settings available are author, description, defaultBranch, homePage, mainScript, name, nextflowVersion, and version
