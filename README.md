# Dockstore Fundamentals: Introduction to Docker and Descriptors for Reproducible Analysis

This is our BCC 2020 workshop meant to introduce new users to the technologies Dockstore depends on.
A [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shMr_Bd01Ko&t=3226s) was made from parts of the East and West sessions of the workshop.
You can also follow along using the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iXDZcP2Eln4hAHWqblmfV_cwABrt7ti9daf32h5nSIQ/edit?usp=sharing) that are from the event.
